\section{Motivation}
Throughout human history, humanity has struggled with overcoming the outbreak of diseases.
Bacteria, viruses, parasites and other causes for sickness are omnipresent on our planet\cite{balloux2017q}. Some are
relatively easy to overcome for most individuals, like Influenza\cite{cdc_influenza}. Others, like the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV),
can have a severe impact on an individual's life\cite{chaponda2018systematic,ji2007impact}. In addition to the impact sickness has
on the live of individuals, diseases and how they spread, have a huge impact on our societies. Hospitals need to be 
build and staffed with doctors, nurses and other facility members. Supply chains need to be established and maintained in order
to manufacture drugs and materials that can be used to cure patients. Research must be conducted, and new treatments need to be
established to increase the chances of a positive outcome. This entire network of services is costly in terms of time, effort
and money used to both establish and maintain it. It is therefor incredibly important to control the spread of diseases early,
in order to prevent damages on both an individual and an economical level.
A good example for the impacts of a rapidly spreading disease is the ongoing ``severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2''
(SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic. Much political and scientific debate in the past two years has revolved around options to better
understand and predict the properties that cause the rapid spreading of this disease. 

%In 2019, the United States of America spend
%16.77\% of their GDP (gross domestic product) on healthcare expenditures\cite{WHO site}. This shows that managing public health
%is important for every society in order to both stay competitive economically and provide citizens with a high quality of live.\newline

\section{Research goals}
This work aims to contribute to the previously mentioned field
and build on the work of Rastogi et al.\cite{Rastogi}. In his work the ``SEIRD'' model\cite{Wittum1,Wittum2} was used to
model the spreading of COVID-19 in 7 major cities of Germany on a 2-dimensional grid (2-D grid). This work follows up on this, by
modeling COVID-19 spreading in the 26 interconnected region of Hesse, Germany. In doing so we focus on the following questions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How well does the SEIRD model performs in a setting with more regions?
	\item How well does the current optimization strategy work?
	\item What are potential areas of improvement of the model?
\end{enumerate}

In order to achieve these goals the SEIRD model was modified in an effort to better represent the conditions of the real world.
Additionally modifications to the model implementation were introduced to enable the model to clearly differentiate between different
regions on the grid. Lastly the model was tested with different data conditions, and the results analyzed in multiple ways.

%Even though huge progress has been made in the fight against infectious diseases (a notable example being the eradication of
%small pox\cite{??}), sickness due to infectious diseases remain a common phenomenon in modern civilizations. Viruses are
%among the most successful organisms in spreading between populations of both humans and animals\cite{??}. The most notable example
%for this is the currently ongoing ``severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2'' (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 or
%coronavirus disease 2019 (short COVID-19) was first observed in an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019\cite{??}.
%From there it started to spread around the globe and on March, 11 2020, the world health organization declared a world wide pandemic\cite{??}.\newline
%\par
%Managing this pandemic has been a huge challenge in the past two years and much debate has revolved around managing the spread of this
%infectious disease. To this end, scientists from many different fields have researched the properties of this virus in order to better
%understand and predict how COVID-19 spreads in our societies. One of these fields is a branch of computer science and math, that aims to
%model the spread of infectious diseases, such as  COVID-19, using differential equations. This work aims to contribute to this field and
%%provide insight in the process of modeling the spread of infectious diseases on a two-dimensional grid using the SEIRD method. 
%provide insight in the process of modeling the spread of infectious diseases, by building on the work of Rastogi et al.\cite{rastogi}.
%In this work the ``SEIRD'' model\cite{wittum} was applied to seven major cities of Germany on a 2-dimensional (2D) grid. This work
%follows up on this, by simulating COVID-19 spreading on 26 interconnected regions in the federal state of Hesse, Germany.

%This work aims to provide insight into the nature of the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. In a previous work Rastogi et al.\cite{rastogi}

%explored the capability of the ``SEIRD'' model\cite{wittum} (detailed explanation in the \hyperref[sec:SEIRD]{following sections}).
%In his work he simulated the features of the COVID-19 pandemic in seven major cities of Germany on a 2-dimensional (2D) grid. While the
%results are interesting it remained unclear, how the model performs when simulating interconnected areas in a larger landscape.\newline

%\par
%In order to better understand the SEIRD model, a 2D grid of the German region of Hesse was created and used to simulate the spreading of
%the COVID-19 virus in the uninfected portion of the population. In addition, two parameters, that are regulating the spreading behavior
%in the model, were investigated closer. This analysis aimed to better understand the influence of the individual parameters on the modeling
%process itself.
