The following chapter describes the methodological approach we took when investigating the SEIRD model. We aim to
present and explain the model adjustments that were made and the tools and methods used in the context of this work.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	SECTION 1
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Problem definition}
\label{sec:problemDef}
%The goal of modeling is always to invent a model that is capable of correctly reproducing past and reliably predicting 
%future events. The latter is often very difficult, since it is necessary to correctly understand the dynamics of a
%complex system and then implement these dynamics in the form of a program, algorithm or method.\newline

%\par
The previous work of Rastogi \cite{Rastogi} investigated the SEIRD model on a 2-D grid of Germany. In his work, Rastogi simulated
all five groups of the SEIRD model for seven cities in Germany. This proved that the model itself is functional and,
in principle, capable of reproducing and predicting the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic/endemic events. \newline

\par
The goal of this work was to better understand the model performs in a smaller scale environment and to improve
the quality of the results. Hesse (Germany) and its regions were chosen as a template for a new 2-D grid. To minimize the
error propagation throughout the SEIRD groups, we decided to focus on optimizing the fist class of individuals, the Susceptible (\B{S}) group.
In this context, we tried to reproduce/predict real-world data and upcoming trends. Additionally, we focused on evaluating the
sensitivity of \B{S} to the two variables $\alpha$ and $q$ and analyzing the currently implemented optimization strategy.

\section{Data acquisition and model adjustment}
The following section will explain the processes of data acquisition, issues and modifications done to the SEIRD model
to improve the quality of the results.

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Data acquisition}
\label{sec:datacoll}
In order to perform SEIRD simulations, it was necessary to gather precise real-world data for as many of the five groups as possible.
The source for this data was the Github project \cite{Gehrcke}, which provided both the number of COVID-19 infections
and COVID-19 related deaths per region in Germany. The repository provides data based on the case/death
numbers published by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the Risklayer GmbH. The data used in this work is based on the
data published by the RKI. The data format was cumulative case/death numbers per region per day.\newline

\par
The hospitalization rate of confirmed COVID-19 infected individuals, the average time till symptom onset, the average time till
hospitalization and the lethality rate of an infection were gathered from RKI publications \cite{RKIcov}.\newline 
\par
The population of each region in Hesse was taken from the website of ``Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt''. The data was sourced from
\cite{HessePop} in the category ``Bef\"olkerung in Hessen 2017 bis 2020 nach Verwaltungsbezirk in Monaten''. The size of each region in Hesse
was taken from \cite{HesseSize}.

\subsection{SEIRD model adjustments}
\label{sec:SEIRDredef}
In order to reach the goals described in \hyperref[sec:problemDef]{section \ref*{sec:problemDef}}, we decided to alter
the definitions of the Exposed (\B{E}) and Infected (\B{I}) groups. Furthermore, we decided to set the variable
$\kappa$ to 1, effectively removing the option of exposed individuals to recover without developing symptoms. These
changes were done for two reasons.\newline

First, data availability proved to be an issue. The problem is that the number of infected individuals in the
collected data set only includes individuals where the COVID-19 pathogen could be isolated in a laboratory setting or
that were tested positive with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test\cite{RKIcase}. However,
these tests are usually conducted if an individual is experiencing symptoms of sickness. This means that individuals who did
not experience symptoms were mostly not represented in the collected data. In addition, it was difficult to estimate
the ratio between infected individuals that experience symptoms and individuals that do not experience symptoms. This made it
even harder make reasonable assumptions on which bases the original data could be modified to account for this phenomenon.\newline

The second reason for these changes is a potentially better representation of the actual disease phases of a COVID-19 infection. Many infections
between susceptible and exposed individuals happen before the exposed develop symptoms. While sick individuals can still infect others
days after symptom onset, about half of all transmissions are pre-symptomatic \cite{casey2021presymptomatic} and that symptom onset generally
reduces transmission rates due to isolation measures\cite{RKIcov}.\newline

Based on this information, we did not allow direct recovery in our model and redefined the \B{E} and \B{I} groups as follows.
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]
	\item \B{Exposed (E)}: Group of individuals that are infected with the virus and will develop symptoms in the upcoming
		days. Individuals are contagious during this time and contribute to infections of susceptibles.
	\item \B{Infected (I)}: Group of individuals that has stared to experience symptoms. Individuals are mostly not contagious anymore
		and isolate themself/are isolated until recovery or death.
\end{enumerate}

Of course these assumptions do not fully represent the real-world dynamics of COVID-19 disease spreading. However, based on
the information described above, we assume that these changes improve the overall accuracy of the model and the interpretation of real-world data.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	SECTION 2
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Experimental setup and pre-simulation work}
The following section will describe the assumptions made based on the previous explanations, the generation of a suitable data set and
the pre-processing of the newly created data.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Assumptions}
Based on the collected information, we made a set of assumptions to derive our experimental data from the raw data.
These assumptions are as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The average time for an exposed individual to develop symptoms is six days.
	\item After symptom development, an individual begins self-isolation and does not contribute to new infections. It transitions to the \B{I} group.
	\item The average time for a symptomatic individual (\B{I} group) to lose most of its symptoms and contagiousness is about ten days. This was defined as
		a transition to the recovered (R) state.
	\item The average time between symptom onset and death was about eleven days during the first infection wave in Germany. This was
		defined as a transition to the diseased (D) state.
	\item Based on points \B{3.} and \B{4.} we estimated a transition time from \B{E} to either \B{R} or \B{D} of 10 days. Using the
		average of 10.5 days was not possible since only one data point per day was available.
\end{enumerate}


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Data pre-processing}
Since the raw data was cumulative, we used the previously mentioned assumptions to define the number of individuals in each group at time point $t$ as follows:

\begin{align}
	S(t) &= N - i(t+6)\\
	E(t) &= i(t+5) - i(t)\\
	I(t) &= i(t) - i(t-10)\\
	R(t) &= i(t-10) - d(t)\\
	D(t) &= d(t)
\end{align}

\par
Where $N$ represents the total number of individuals living in a specific region of Hesse at the beginning of the pandemic, $i(t)$
represents the cumulative number of infected individuals at time $t$ and $d(t)$ represents the cumulative number of deceased
individuals at time $t$. These calculations were done for each region, time point and group.\newline

We chose to simulate the time frame between the 1\I{st} of September 2020 and the 15\I{th} of November 2020 (76 days in total). These
data points were chosen since no significant policy changes regarding protective measures against COVID-19 infections
(mask mandates, isolation periods, store closures)  were made during this time in Germany. Thus hopefully providing a more stable system
without hard-to-predict variables. Additionally, this time frame was before other COVID-19 variants were first observed in
Germany\cite{RKIvariants}. It can therefore be assumed, that only the original CODIV-19 strain from Wuhan was contributing to infections.\newline

Each group was calculated for each day in each region. For the first day of the simulation (day 0), the percentage of each group at that
point in time was calculated. These values were used as the starting point for all simulations.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Generation of a 2-D grid of Hesse}
For the simulation, a 2-D grid of Hesse was created using the program ProMesh4. The grid was manually drawn and consisted
of 1075 vertices and 3049 edges, from which 1975 faces (triangular volumes) were constructed, and was divided into 26 regions,
representing the 26 autonomous regions of Hesse. The geometry and properties of the grid (also called mesh in the context of computational simulation)
make it unstructured. A visual representation of the grid and an exemplary
image of the original geography of Hesse are shown in \hyperref[fig:2-D_grid]{Figure \ref*{fig:2-D_grid}}.

%That means, that vertices can be positioned and connected arbitrarily. This method provides more flexibility then

\section{SEIRD simulation}

\subsection{Inherited SEIRD model implementation}
The experiments of this work were  performed using the model implementation previously established and kindly provided by
Rastogi et al.\cite{Rastogi}. The code provided included a functional implementation of the UG4 'EpidemicsRunner', as well as
the epidemics\_app folder used for  the previously mentioned project. The code was mainly Lua based and served as a base
for modifications and additional features added during this work. Changes and additions included both streamlining the simulation process
and setting up the simulation experiments, used to generate the results. The base file used to run the SEIRD simulation was epidemics.lua,
which was originally written by Prof. Gabriel Wittum and Dr. Arne N\"agel, and later modified by Devansh Rastogi and Tristan Scheidemann.
The previously mentioned Lua files serve as a platform for the underlying UG4 framework, which reads the files and executes more
performance oriented commands in other programming languages. 

\subsection{Process sequence of SEIRD simulations}
Simulations were performed as previously described by Rastogi et al.\cite{Rastogi}.
The implemented SEIRD simulation is based on an ugx file, that describes the geometry of the simulated regions. The file is provided
by the user and contains a number of vectors and edges. Vectors are grouped together to form regions, while edges describe possible
interactions between vectors that can be used to simulate migration between vectors. When the SEIRD model is started, specific starting
conditions defined in the Lua code are applied to each grid region. From there, the simulation is run for each
vector, and the results are saved in an output file. If parameter optimization is performed, the results are then modified and processed
using the \I{ConstrainedOptimization} plugin (see \hyperref[sec:post_proc]{section \ref*{sec:post_proc}} for details).

\subsection{Variable optimization}
Tow different methods were used to solve the partial differential equations (\B{PDE}) of the model.
The first method was the \I{Gauss-Newton} algorithm, the second was a \I{Particle Swarm Optimization} (PSO) algorithm.
During the experimental phase of the project, both methods were used to investigate the questions answered in this work.
PSO was first used to roughly estimate possible target values, while \I{Gauss-Newton} was used to refine the previous findings.
Even though both methods showed similar results, all data presented in the result section of this work were created
using the \I{Gauss-Newton} algorithm. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	SECTION 4
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data post-processing and variable optimization}
\label{sec:post_proc}
In order to optimize simulation results, the variables of the model equations had to be automatically adjusted based on
the loss value of the previous simulation. This section explains the steps that were undertaken to achieve this goal.

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Output-grid association}
The simulation results were output in the form of density values associated with two coordinate positions ($x$ and $y$ on the
original grid). In order to processed the simulation results, it was necessary to associate each of these
values with the correct region of the Hesse grid. To do so, the program \I{geometry\_parser.lua} was written. The program reads a config file and
then parses and saves the positional information of each vertex in the grid and to which region it belongs from the .ugx file of the grid.
The program then compares the simulation results with the parsed data and associates each result value with a region. Lastly, the program \I{convert\_values.lua}
is used to average the result values
for each region and time point, converts the average from densities to number of individuals per group and then saves the output in separate files.
One file per SEIRD group is created. \I{convert\_values.lua} was originally written by Devansh Rastogi and Tristan Scheidemann and later modified to
better suit the needs of this project. During simulations in which variables are optimized, the results are used to execute the program \I{ConstrainedOptimization}.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Loss function}
In order to quantify the precision with which the simulation was able to reproduce the original data and optimize variables, the loss function $L$
was applied. Parameters of this function were the regions of Hesse $r$, a point in time $t$, the original data depending on
region and point in time $o(r_i,t_i)$, and the simulated data depending on region and point in time $s(r_i, t_i)$. Figure \ref*{eq:loss_newton}
shows the equation.

%\textcolor{red}{do more mathematically correct}

\begin{align}
	L &= \sum_{r_0=0}^{25} \sum_{t_{0}=0}^{t} (o(r_i,t_i) - s(r_i,t_i))^{2}
	\label{eq:loss_newton}
\end{align}


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 3
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Variable optimization via \I{ConstrainedOptimization}}
The variables $\alpha$ and $q$ of the SEIRD system were optimized using the \I{ConstrainedOptimization} plugin for UG4\cite{Scheidemann}.
The plugin was used to optimize these variables using both the \I{Gauss-Newton} algorithm and PSO. The other variables $\kappa$, $\tau$ and $p$ were set to static
values for the simulations. $\kappa$ was set to 1 (all \B{E} transition to \B{I}), $\tau$ was set to 0.005 (0.5\% of all \B{I} succumb to the disease
and transition to \B{D}) and $p$ was set to 10 (average duration till a member of \B{I} transitions to either \B{R} or \B{D} is 10 days).


%Step sizes for individual time points were adjusted while using the \I{Gauss-Newton} algorithm. This was done via the Frank-Wolf algorithm\cite{Rastogi,frank-wolf}. %note add citaions


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 4
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Geometry sampling}
In order to better understand the sensitivity of the model for different variables, geometry sampling was done. This means that a set range for the
investigated variables was chosen, and simulations were performed with randomly chosen values for said variables. After each simulation, the total
loss of the simulation attempt was calculated and recorded. This data was then used to create a topographic map of the relation between variables
and the total loss of the simulation. In this work, we observed the relation between loss and the variables $\alpha$ and $q$. These variables
were chosen as they are the two variables influencing the observed group \B{S}.The program used for this task was the
\I{geometry\_sampler} provided in \I{ConstrainedOptimization}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	SECTION 4
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data evaluation}
Data analysis of the simulation results was one of the main parts of this work. This section will highlight the techniques and tools used during this process.

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Box plots}
Presenting the amount of data that was acquired in a compact and presentable way proved to be challenging. We decided to use box plots
as one of the main methods of presenting our data, as they convey much information to the reader without being too overwhelming.
Each box plot is made up of multiple elements listed below.\newpage

\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]
	\item A Minimum
	\item A Maximum
	\item The first Quartile (Q1)
	\item The third Quartile (Q3)
	\item The interquartile range (IQR)
	\item The Median
	\item The Outliers of the data set
\end{enumerate}


The Median is the middle value of the entire data set and lies between Q1 and Q3. Q1  is the Median 
between the lowest value of the data set and the Median of the entire data set. Thus 25\% of all data points are below, and 75\%
are above Q1. Reversely Q3 is the Median value between the Median and the
highest value of the entire data set. Thus 75\% of all data points are below, and 25\% are above Q3.
The difference between Q1 and Q3 is called the interquartile range (IQR). The Minimum and Maximum are
defined as $\text{Minimum} = Q1 - x*\text{IQR}$ and $\text{Maximum} = Q3 + x*\text{IQR}$, where $x$ was set to 1.5.
All values in the data set, which are located outside of the Minimum or Maximum, are called Outliners and represented as circles.
\hyperref[fig:boxplot]{Figure~\ref*{fig:boxplot}} summarizes these definitions in an image.

			components of the plot.}

\end{figure}


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Custom programs}
In order to present the results, three custom programs were written. \I{deviation\_graph.py} was used to compare the data points of
individual regions. Graphs were created using Matplotlib and NumPy. Shortened data sets were extrapolated by fitting a polynomial
of degree three to the simulated data points. The resulting function was then extrapolated to highlight trends of the
analyzed data set. \I{deviation\_boxplot.py} was used to create box plots, and \I{sensitivity\_plot} was used to visualize the
relation between $\alpha$, $q$ and the loss function in a three-dimensional graph.
