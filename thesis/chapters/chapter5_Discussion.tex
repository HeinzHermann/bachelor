This chapter will summarize, interpret and discuss the results of \hyperref[chap:results]{section
\ref*{chap:results}}. We will start by discussing and evaluating the model's accuracy in  reproducing
real-world data, as well as the ability of the model to predict future outcomes with fewer data points. Second, we will
interpret the results of the loss function analysis and the sensitivity analysis in order to understand the simulation
results better and identify potential issues and areas of improvement. Lastly, an outlook will be given for possible strategies and
ideas to improve the implementation of the model and the model itself.

\section{Simulation results and sensitivity analysis}
The following section will discuss the results of the simulations, the optimization process, and the sensitivity
analysis performed in this context.

\subsection{Simulation accuracy and optimization issues}
\hyperref[sec:sim_res]{Section \ref*{sec:sim_res}} presented the simulation results produced by the current implementation
of the SEIRD model. It can be seen that both the simulation's accuracy and the ability to predict future trends
depend on the amount of data points supplied. While the median susceptible deviation across all simulations ranged between
-80 and +142 percent, most regions showed much lower deviation rates. In the case of the 76 data point simulation, 20 of 26 regions showed an
absolute median deviation of 50 percent or less. Similar behavior was observed for the 60 and the 50 data point simulations, where
21 regions showed an absolute median deviation of 50 percent or less. \newline

%While the simulation accuracy of single regions
%might differ between experiments (\textcolor{red}{double check this!}), results are overall comparable.\newline

Predicting the original data proved more difficult. While the calculated trend for the 60 data point experiment was comparable
to the simulation with 76 data points, the 50 data point simulation trend showed substantial differences and proved to be mostly inaccurate.
The main observation, in this case, was a strong shift in the simulation results towards fewer infections.
This is most likely the case, because the number of transition events (infections) tends to be roughly exponential.
Since the growth of such a dynamic is stronger towards the end, removing these data points from the simulated data likely
caused this issue. Overall, the model seems to be able to somewhat reasonably predict infection dynamics with fewer data points than
initially used, as long as not too many of the data points are lost, that mark the beginning of the exponential growth phase.\newline

A consistent observation throughout all experiments was that the regions showed a strong trend to negatively deviate from the
original data. This means that the simulations generally predicted lower amounts of exposed individuals than the original
data. In all three experiments, 17 or more of 26 regions deviated in this way from the original data. This phenomenon can be explained
by remembering how optimization was implemented in these experiments.
All adjustments were made based on minimizing the loss function. The loss function was defined in
\hyperref[eq:loss_newton]{equation \ref*{eq:loss_newton}} as the sum of the square difference between the simulated and the original
data of all data points and each region. This means that a region's influence on the adjustment of model variables
increases as the total difference between its simulated and original data grows. This effect is further increased since the
difference between original and simulated data is squared before it is summed up. Therefore, leading to a quadratic increase of influence
of highly deviating regions relative to the other regions. \newline

Combining this knowledge with the observations of the model results, we can identify three factors that influence
the currently implemented optimization strategy of the model.\newline

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item The percentage deviation of the simulated data from the original data.
	\item The time at which the deviation occurs.
	\item The total population of each individual region.
\end{enumerate}

The first point is very intuitive. The loss analysis has shown that the most influential region in our 76 data point experiment was ``Offenbach'' with
a mean deviation of -54 percent after optimization took place. This means that half of the simulated data points of this region
had less than half as many transitions from the susceptible group (\B{S}) to the exposed group (\B{E}) when compared with 
the original data.
%This should and does cause adjustments of the model variables. but it also transitions well to the second factor.
The point in time when the deviation occurs also has influence on the calculation of the loss. In our experiments, many regions
displayed strong percentile deviations during the first days of the simulation, where changes in the real-world data were very
sporadic due to the small number of infected individuals. An example is a 467.4 percent deviation
in the case of ``Limburg-Weilburg'', where the model predicted 4.674 additional infections compared to only one real-world infection.
This also means that the absolute difference between simulated and original data is usually much
smaller during the early days of the simulation than in the later stages of the simulation. So even though the
calculated deviation was extremely high, the effect on the loss was very small.
The third major factor is the overall population of each respective region. Regions with a high population tend to
produce higher absolute differences between simulated and original data than regions with smaller populations, even if the percentage
deviation is comparable.  A good example of this
is the region ``Frankfurt-am-Main'' which was the third strongest loss contributor in the optimized version of the model, despite
only showing a median deviation of about 21 percent between simulated and original data. This is caused by the high population of
this region, which makes up about 12.14 percent of the total population of Hesse.\newline

All these effects combined mean, that both outliers and high population areas can and likely will disproportionately effect the
optimization process of the model. The question is whether this effect is desired or not. Arguably the model optimization was
working in terms of minimizing the total loss for the highest possible population. However, the smaller overall loss was achieved by
reducing the accuracy of many smaller regions in favor of outlier regions and regions with higher populations. We will discuss alternatives to this method in the
following sections.

\subsection{Variable influence on the susceptible population}
In order to better understand the influence of model variables on the simulation of the
susceptible population, we performed a sensitivity analysis on $\alpha$ and $q$.
Observing these two variables was sufficient in this case, since they were the only
variables influencing the susceptible group. Equations \ref{eq:SEIRD1_S} and \ref{eq:SEIRD1_E}
from chapter \ref*{chap:theory} are shown below, and can be used to deduce all relevant variables that influence the rate of
change in this group.

\begin{align*}
	\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\alpha S E \tag{\ref*{eq:SEIRD1_S}} \label{eq:SEIRD2_S}\\
	\frac{dE}{dt} &= \alpha S E -\frac{1}{q} E \tag{\ref*{eq:SEIRD1_E}} \label{eq:SEIRD2_E}
\end{align*}

Equation \ref*{eq:SEIRD2_S} shows that influencing variables for the change of \B{S} are the number of susceptibles \B{S},
the number of exposed \B{E} and the rate $\alpha$ at which individuals transition from \B{S} to \B{E}. The rate of change for \B{E},
in equation \ref*{eq:SEIRD2_E}, again depends on \B{S}, \B{E} and $\alpha$, but also on $q$. Other variables or groups do not
influence the change of \B{S} directly or indirectly and are consequently not relevant for this analysis. \newline

The results of the sensitivity analysis show
that both $\alpha$ and $q$ influence the loss. \hyperref[fig:sensitivity_zoom0]{Figure \ref*{fig:sensitivity_zoom0}} and
\hyperref[fig:sensitivity_zoom1]{Figure \ref*{fig:sensitivity_zoom1}} show
that the overall loss of the simulation remains fairly identical until $\alpha$ reaches a value of about 0.17. Before this,
changes in $q$ seem to have little impact on the loss of the simulation. This makes sense when looking at the relation between
equations \ref*{eq:SEIRD1_S} and \ref*{eq:SEIRD1_E}. A change in loss is caused by either an increase or a decrease in transition events
between \B{S} and \B{E}. The number of these events depends on the population of \B{S}, \B{E} and the size of $\alpha$.
A small $\alpha$ value will not only cause fewer transitions by itself but also decrease the number members of the \B{E} group, thereby 
decreasing the number of subsequent transition events twofold. The reverse is true for high $\alpha$ values, where a high
number of transitions leads to a big population in \B{E}, which in turn causes even more transitions.
The variable $q$ plays a more indirect role by governing the transition events out of \B{E}. Changes in this variable
can only impact the population of \B{E} and thereby influence \B{S} transitions if a population of \B{E} is present in
the first place. This may not be the case for low $\alpha$ values, explaining why $q$ only impacts the loss once the
previously mentioned threshold for $\alpha$ is overcome.\newline

The static loss observed in \hyperref[fig:sensitivity_zoom0]{figure \ref*{fig:sensitivity_zoom0}} at smaller $\alpha$ values likely means
that no or almost no transitions from \B{S} to \B{E} take place in any simulation performed within this range of values. This
leads to a static difference between simulated and real-world data and in turn to a static loss. The figure also shows the
previously mentioned effect, that after a certain threshold, $\alpha$ causes a great number of transitions from \B{S} to \B{E}, which
leads to even more transitions due to the now higher population of \B{E}. This is likely the reason for the rapid increase in loss
after an $\alpha$ value of about 0.25. \newline 

Once $\alpha$ is causing a number of transitions, $q$ can influence the loss by causing transition events out of \B{E}.
This effect likely leads to the formation of the ``optimal valley'' between $\alpha$ values 0.17 to 0.23 and $q$ values
5.5 to 8.0, observed in figure \ref*{fig:sensitivity_zoom1}. In this area of values, multiple combinations of $\alpha$ and
$q$ seem to lead to a nearly optimal loss value. All of the observed effects can be explained by the model's mechanics, indicating that
it behaves as intended.

\section{Model adjustments and solutions}
In the previous section, we discussed the results, different effects observed during the experiments and explained what
likely causes these effects. This section will focus on discussing possible adjustments to the model and its implementation
in order to increase the overall performance.


%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Simultaneous variable optimization of multiple regions}
A prominent issue in this work was how the loss of different regions was biasing the variable optimization process. Currently, the loss
favors regions that either strongly differ from their original data, have a high population relative to the other regions or
both. This can cause few regions to dominate the optimization process, while most regions influence the optimization only marginally.
This can lead to cases where many regions only show similarities and few or no regions accurately represent their original data. \newline

A simple adjustment to this problem could be not to compare the absolute values of the SEIRD groups but instead to compare the
densities of the respective groups to calculated densities of the original data. This would remove biases based on the population
of a region and instead cause the optimization procedure to focus on all regions equally. This, however, is mostly shifting the model's
bias from one area to another. It could be argued that the model correctly tries to optimize the variables in such a way that the greatest
number of group members are as close to the real-world data as possible. Since this change (or any other type of normalization) will likely
not solve the baseline issue that different regions require different transition rates at different times. Therefor, it stands to reason that
additional adjustments to the model are necessary.

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Alternative options for modeling improvements}
An alternative to changing the loss function would be to introduce population or population-density dependent variables
to the model. This idea seems especially desirable since it also tackles a more conceptual issue with the current model. Currently 
the model mostly tries to reproduce past events based on previously acquired data points. While this is good to get a general
idea of epidemiological dynamics, the prediction power of such a system can be limited. Adding variables to the model
that specifically try to account for the epidemiological differences between high-density and low-density population areas could
be a good solution to this problem. This should not only improve the overall accuracy of the simulation but also increase its 
predictive power by bringing the underlying equations of the model closer to what epidemiological spreading actually looks like in a real-world setting.
\newline

While the benefits this option provides could be very impactful, its implementation comes with major challenges. Finding a suitable and quantifiable
dependency between population density and infection dynamics might be complex and may not be uniform between different
regions. For example, while population-infection dependencies between different regions in Germany might be comparable, population-infection
dependencies in other regions of the world like the USA, India, China, Russia or Africa might be very different. In order to compensate
for cultural, climatic and other differences between regions, it would likely be necessary to apply optimization protocols to these
variables. Nonetheless, while much work, this option is likely one of the most promising improvements to the model in its current state.\newline 

%diffusion
Another promising improvement which could be implemented, is to try and optimize the model by adding varying degrees of
diffusion between regions. A system like this would help to bring the modeling system closer to real-world conditions. The current
model implementation includes a system like this and could help to improve results further. However, it was not included
in this work since it would likely provide much better improvements if the previously discussed issues with region weighting
and population/population density dependencies were resolved.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
The main scope of this work was to test the previously established SEIRD model with more and more similar, interconnected regions.
During the previous work by Rastogi et al.\cite{Rastogi} the current implementation of the model was established and tested in the
context of seven big cities in Germany. This work improved the 2D map, the overall implementation of the SERID model, expanded
the scope from 7 similar regions to 26 regions with diverse populations and living conditions and focused on the
details of the inner working and the optimization process of the model by analyzing the first transition step from the susceptible
to the exposed group.\newline

The results of the work are in line with our expectations. The current model implementation
optimizes towards the correct number of infection events, but deviations from the real-world data are common. The reason for
this are the weighting of different regions against one another and a lack of additional variables that help to account for
intrinsic differences between the regions. Urban regions, like big cities, will likely have a different infection dynamic
than rural regions with small villages and generally lower population density.\newline

Nevertheless, the results presented in this work help evaluate the current implementation of the SERID model and identify
key features that can be modified or added to improve the overall modeling quality. Once this is done, the precision with
which previously acquired data is modeled and the predictive capabilities of the model should improve. This could make
the model an even more valuable tool to predict the development of future endemic or pandemic events and help both scientists and official
institutions to better understand the dynamics of infectious disease spreading.
